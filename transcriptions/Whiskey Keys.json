  "text": "Piano, sobbing in the moonlight Whiskey glass crack, reflection of my bruised fight Dust on the floor, cowboy boots been dragging away Harder jewel box, spinning tracks that just won't fade Whiskey keys, they play my pain, every know the drop of rain Pull the hurt, let it flow, where it stops I don't ever know Melodya mistakes, chords heavy like a freight Train rank of my regrets, each no pudding at my chain Bar is too confession, secrets in the ass tray, eight always thumb But the piano keeps the heart it, echoes in the bottle, drowning in the sound Piano is my secrets, trapeze holding ground Whiskey keys, they play my pain, every know the drop of rain Pull the hurt, let it flow, where it stops I don't ever know Trapeze near snaps like a whip on my back, piano homes low like a train on the track Two worlds collide, where the cowboy ties in the eight always thumb till the heart accepts I don't ever know, I don't ever know",
