You see it, yeah. Mine's sharp, cuz still, I'm a cleaver, I'm a cleaver. I'm climbing up the game, no rest, no breathing. Yeah, yeah. Sitting on my back, streets talk, I listen, moves up clean. My shadow and distance, stacks, stacks. Don't skyscraper ambition, flow so sick. I've been remissioned, baseline thumping. It's a heart attack, words cut deep can't take it back. Inferno rising flames on track. Baseline thumping, thumping black. Yeah! Co-crack the venture, rat monolisa. Rat monolisa. They pray for my father, I'm a believer. I'm a believer. Keep the circle tight, no room for the sieve. It's true for the sieve. Ah! Plastic twitch art movie, theater features. Theater features. Ah! Eyes wide, every corner got a Judas. Keep the snakes. I'm a ducer, clueless, 12 knocking. But my crew moved roofless. Future too bright, had to tend to roofless. Hands on the clock, can't turn it back. Streets run cold, I stay on the tag. Pins my weapon, never need a strat. World's amazing, I'm mapping the gap. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Ah!",
