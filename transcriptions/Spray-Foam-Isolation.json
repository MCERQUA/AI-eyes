She's my friend, I'm all a family like you, but she's worse, I'm coming down to call something like it. She's sick, wrecked the entertainer, you feel the truth. I'm not that smart, bad to ask to do. Could she say that I'm living? I'm on rows around the way I do, and I'm not on it, I can't bend. And she's telling me that night's been, I love you. A short jingle about spray foam, isolation. And she's turned boarded out for Christ to have. And she's driving on the Friday with the dodge inside my head. I know man that I'll be waiting on. She said, Harry, your pain needs to make you feel like hell. She's telling me that I'm not on the Friday with the dodge inside my head. And she's telling me that night's been, I love you.
