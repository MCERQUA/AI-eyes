Smokefield, kitchen pots never stop burning Bill's stack high, mom's dreams kept spoiling Rico Han scrubbed floor's for the wrench She prayed to the sky, but the heaven's state is silent Broken glass symphony silence all alone by She wore a heavy heart but never let it selling die Corners of the block, my school and my church, mama said, son, don't let this world quench your worth Mama's crown never fell, though the world tried to break her, then the jungle of the ghetto, she saved my maker Blood swearing tears, her fight was profound through the pain and the struggle, she wore her crown Food stamps, liquor store shadows in the alley, gunshots from place bursting and in the valley Mama ducked low, shielded me from the blaze, told me boy the same forever just to pass and phase She hustle like queen with a mop and a dream, turn rags and the riches in the way I see Burrow time or burrow time, she made it all stretch, gave me love and a lesson in every breath she felt She said the ghetto don't define you, it's just the frame, hold your head high son and carry my name",
