  "text": "Yeah, I'm a renusser, but in muscle, everything's a prayer, everything's a puzzle, we don't back down, we don't poke, contracting trains with a heart of gold. Calis-Hands, gripping the chip, coffee cup, sunrise creepin' time to lace the boots up, steel toe stomping on gravel and grit, blue prints in my head, I ain't no room to quit. The hammer sings sweet nails dance on the wood building dreams for folks making rough things look good. Yeah, I'm a renusser, but in muscle, everything's a prayer, everything's a puzzle, we don't back down, we don't poke, contracting trains with a heart of gold. Yeah, I'm a renusser, but in muscle, all everything's a prayer, everything's a puzzle, we don't back down, we don't poke, contracting trains with a heart of gold. Sweat dripping, shirt clings to my spine, saw dust snowing, that's my delegrained concrete whisper story. So the past foundations we pour, built to last, lunchtime laughs over tailgate fees. Families at home, but here's my second piece, broken backs, but unbroken pride, we build a future one blanket of time. Yeah, I'm a renusser, but in muscle, everything's a prayer, everything's a puzzle, we don't back down, we don't poke, contracting trains with a heart of gold. Yeah, I'm a renusser, but in muscle, everything's a prayer, everything's a puzzle, we don't back down, we don't poke, contracting trains with a heart of gold. Rain soap, check its storms, came to turn, where the backbone, unseen, unsung workers through blistered palms, and making bombs, we carve out spaces, folks call.",
