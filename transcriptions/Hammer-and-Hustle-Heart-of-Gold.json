  "text": ". . Calis-Hands gripping the chip coffee cups, Sunrise creeping time to lace the boots up, Still toast off an ongrabble and grit, Blue prints in my head ain't no room to quit. The hammer sings sweet nails, dance on the wood, Building dreams for folks making rough things look good. Hammer and hustle, blood and muscle, Every swings of prayer, every board's a puzzle. We don't back down, we don't fold, Contracting dreams with a heart of gold. Sweat dripping, shirt clings to my spine, So to snowing, that's my daily grind. Concrete whisper stories of the past, Foundations we poured, built to last. Lunchtime laughs, over till gate fees, Families at home, but here's my second piece. Broken bags, but unbroken pride, We build the future, one plank at a time. One plank at a time. Hammer and hustle, blood and muscle, Every swings of prayer, every board's a puzzle. We don't back down, we don't fold. Contracting dreams with a heart of gold. Rain so jacky, storms can deter, We're the backbone on sand, Unsong workers through, Blister palms and aching bombs, We carve out spaces, folks come home. Hammer and hustle, blood and muscle, Every swings of prayer, every board's a puzzle. We don't back down, we don't fold. Contracting dreams with a heart of gold. With a heart of gold. With a heart of gold. With a heart of gold. With a heart of gold.",
