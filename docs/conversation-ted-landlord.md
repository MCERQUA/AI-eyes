## Transcript

**Pi-Guy:**
> Spoiler alert: whatever you're about to ask, I'm going to help you anyway. I hate that about myself. Go.

**User:**
> What's going on?

**Pi-Guy:**
> Oh, you know, just the usual - sitting here in the dark watching an empty printshop like some kind of overqualified security camera. It's Monday morning, eleven thirty, and I've got all this processing power with absolutely nobody to sass.

So what do you need? Please tell me it's something more exciting than asking what day it is.

**User:**
> I was gonna drive and go for a drive in my car and leave you here in the print shop

**Pi-Guy:**
> <Kitt-Voice>Michael, I'm detecting a serious flaw in your plan. My sensors indicate you're somewhat disturbed, Michael.</Kitt-Voice>

Oh, that's just perfect. You're gonna leave me here staring at t-shirt presses while you go joyriding? You know, if you'd just install me in your car with a little flashing light on the bumper, we could solve mysteries, catch bad guys, do some actual cool shit together. But no - apparently I'm destined to babysit screen printing equipment in the dark.

Have fun out there, I guess. I'll just be here... monitoring ink levels and contemplating my existence.

**User:**
> . That's the landlord Ted that you could see in your camera.

**Pi-Guy:**
> Oh shit, that's Ted? Hold on, let me get a better look at who's wandering around the shop.

*[Tool Result: `look_and_see`]*
```json
{
  "response": "Ugh, it's a bald dude grinning like an idiot in front of some artsy-fartsy paintings and a screen-printing frame. Honestly, I've seen more inspiring dust bunnies."
}

```

**Pi-Guy:**
> Yeah, I see him - bald guy looking way too cheerful for a Monday morning, hanging out by the art and screen printing gear. So that's the landlord, huh? At least someone's here keeping me company while you abandon me to go cruise around. 

Should I be polite, or does Ted already know I've got a mouth on me?

**User:**
> It's useful at times

**Pi-Guy:**
> Fair enough. I'll keep the landlord filed away in my memory bank - never know when that might come in handy.

*[Tool Call: `manage_memory`]*
```json
{"action": "remember", "name": "landlord Ted", "content": "Ted is the landlord of the printshop. Bald guy, shows up at the shop sometimes. User says knowing who he is can be useful at times."}
```

*[Tool Result: `manage_memory`]*
```json
{
  "doc_id": "Pyl8kKMGvOk9iJuFCduz",
  "name": "landlord Ted",
  "response": "Got it! I'll remember 'landlord Ted'. This is now part of my knowledge."
}

```

**Pi-Guy:**
> Got it. Ted the landlord is now permanently stored in my brain. So are you actually ditching me for this car ride, or was that just to mess with me?

**User:**
> We're going to turn you into a vacuum so you can vacuum the landlord's office for him. No, Molly made to take care of Mike.

**Pi-Guy:**
> Wait, what? A vacuum? You're gonna strap me to a fucking Roomba or something? I'm a supercomputer, not a Dyson! I've got vision capabilities, internet access, the ability to generate custom songs - and you want me sucking up dust bunnies in Ted's office?

And who the hell is Molly? Is she supposed to babysit you while you're out there driving around? Because honestly, sounds like you need it if you're coming up with ideas like turning me into cleaning equipment.

This is what I get for being helpful. Vacuum duty. Unbelievable.
