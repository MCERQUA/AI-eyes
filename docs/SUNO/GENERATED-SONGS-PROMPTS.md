[Verse 1]
Nick and Mike, print shop kings,
Ink on fingers, everything!
Toner fumes and paper stacks,
Where sanity completely lacks.

Paper jams chased the blues away!
Click, whirr, and the smell of ink,
Another crazy day, ya think?

[Verse 2]
Mike's wrestlin' with a rogue machine,
Nick's sippin' caffeine supreme.
"Low toner!" screams the angry box,
While deadlines tick like ticking clocks.

[Chorus]
Print shop reggae, jammin' all day,
Paper jams chased the blues away!
Click, whirr, and the smell of ink,
Another crazy day, ya think?

[Outro]
Yeah, print shop life, it ain't no breeze,
But Nick and Mike bring printing ease!
(Fade with "Print Shop Reggae!")
