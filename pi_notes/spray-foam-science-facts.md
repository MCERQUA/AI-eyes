SPRAY FOAM SCIENCE & TECHNICAL FACTS

FOAM CHEMISTRY:
- Spray foam is polyurethane-based, formed from isocyanates and polyols
- Two-component system: Side A (isocyanate) and Side B (polyol)
- Chemical reaction creates heat - can reach 200°F during application
- Blowing agents create foam structure - water for open-cell, chemicals for closed-cell
- Closed-cell uses HFO blowing agents (better for environment than HFC)
- Open-cell foam has 90%+ air content, closed-cell has 90%+ closed gas cells

CELL STRUCTURE DIFFERENCES:
- Open-cell: R-3.5 to R-4 per inch, breathable, vapor permeable
- Closed-cell: R-6 to R-7 per inch, impermeable, structural strength
- Open-cell density: 0.5 to 0.8 lb/ft³, Closed-cell: 1.5 to 3 lb/ft³
- Open-cell absorbs water, closed-cell is waterproof
- Closed-cell adds structural integrity to walls and roofs

THERMAL PROPERTIES:
- Foam eliminates air leakage - biggest energy loss in buildings
- Sealing air leaks can reduce energy costs by 15-30%
- Closed-cell foam achieves R-value of 7 per inch in ideal conditions
- Foam provides continuous insulation without thermal bridging
- Effective in all climates - hot, cold, humid, dry

CURING PROCESS:
- Initial set: 10-15 minutes (tack-free)
- Full cure: 24-48 hours (maximum strength)
- Expands 3-4 times original size during application
- Temperature affects cure time - faster in heat, slower in cold
- Proper ventilation required during application for chemical safety
