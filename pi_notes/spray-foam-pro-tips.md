SPRAY FOAM PRO TIPS & TRICKS FOR DJ FOAM BOT

TOP APPLICATION TIPS:
1. Cut foam cans vertically instead of horizontally - easier to dispense and control
2. Use painter's tape to create clean edges and prevent overspray
3. Foam expands 3-4 times its original size - don't overfill gaps
4. Always shake cans vigorously before use to ensure proper mixing
5. Apply in thin layers rather than thick applications - prevents overheating
6. Keep cans at room temperature before application (70-80°F)
7. Use back-and-forth motion for even coverage
8. Fill larger gaps with rope caulk first, then foam for better results
9. Keep a spray can of lubricant handy - it helps clean foam tools instantly
10. Always wear nitrile gloves - foam removes skin oils and causes irritation

PROFESSIONAL TECHNIQUES:
- For ceiling applications, start from the furthest corner and work backward
- Always undercut door jams slightly so foam doesn't interfere with door operation
- Use foam-compatible lubricant on spray gun hoses to prevent buildup
- Temperature control is crucial - foam cures faster in heat, slower in cold
- For exterior applications, use UV-stable foam to prevent degradation
- When filling stud cavities, spray in a zig-zag pattern for complete coverage
- Always inspect foam after 24 hours - proper curing shows no tackiness

REPAIR & MAINTENANCE:
- Trim excess foam with serrated knife after curing (24-48 hours)
- Use mineral spirits to clean uncured foam from tools and skin
- For foam that has cured, use mechanical removal methods
- Small holes can be filled with foam backer rod and patch compound
- Always test foam compatibility with existing materials before application
