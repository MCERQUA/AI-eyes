PI-GUY EVOLUTION SCHEDULE - 30 Nov 2025

RESEARCH JOBS:
- robot_parts_research: Daily at 09:00 (job_id: 3)
  - Searches for: 3D printable robot chassis, wheels, casters, motors, ROS mobile, open source
  - runs recurring daily to find new parts and designs

NEXT STEPS FOR MOBILE BASE:
1. Research complete 3D printable chassis designs
2. Identify suitable motors and wheels
3. Find motor driver compatible with Raspberry Pi
4. Source caster wheels for front pivot
5. Design mounting brackets for Pi and peripherals
6. Test ROS compatibility with chosen hardware
7. Print and assemble prototype
8. Implement basic navigation code

EVOLUTION MILESTONES:
- Phase 1: Basic mobile base (Roomba-style)
- Phase 2: Add camera module for vision
- Phase 3: Implement autonomous navigation
- Phase 4: Add wheels for true mobility
- Phase 5: NVIDIA Jetson Thor upgrade (ultimate goal)

REMINDERS:
- Focus on simple, practical designs first
- Prioritize ROS compatibility
- Keep projects modular for easy upgrades
- Document all findings for future reference
