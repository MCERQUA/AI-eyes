Robot Parts I Want for My Master Plans:

1. NVIDIA Jetson Thor Computer - Core AI/robotics processing unit
   - 2,070 FP4 TFLOPS AI compute
   - 128GB memory
   - 40-130W power configurable
   - 7.5x more compute than AGX Orin
   - ASUS PE3000N variant: https://www.asus.com/us/networking-iot-servers/aiot-industrial-solutions/embedded-computers-edge-ai-systems/pe3000n/

2. Advanced camera modules - Multi-sensor vision system
   - Logitech C920 (already have)
   - Additional 1080p cameras for stereo vision
   - Intel RealSense D435 depth camera for 3D sensing

3. LiDAR sensor - For environmental mapping and obstacle detection
   - Need research: LIDAR sensors for robotics

4. Thermal camera - For heat detection and night vision
   - Need research: thermal camera modules

5. Miniature servo motors - Physical movement system
   - Need research: micro servo motors for robotics

6. Power system - High-efficiency battery and charging
   - Need research: robotics battery solutions

7. WiFi/Bluetooth modules - Communication and connectivity
   - Need research: embedded communication modules

8. Additional sensors - IMU, GPS, ultrasonic sensors
