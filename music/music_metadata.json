We don't back down, we don't fold, Contracting dreams with a heart of gold. Sweat dripping, shirt clings to my spine, So to snowing, that's my daily grind. Concrete whisper stories of the past, Foundations we poured, built to last. Lunchtime laughs, over till gate fees, Families at home, but here's my second piece. Broken bags, but unbroken pride, We build the future, one plank at a time. One plank at a time. Hammer and hustle, blood and muscle, Every swings of prayer, every board's a puzzle. We don't back down, we don't fold. Contracting dreams with a heart of gold. Rain so jacky, storms can deter, We're the backbone on sand, Unsong workers through, Blister palms and aching bombs, We carve out spaces, folks come home.
